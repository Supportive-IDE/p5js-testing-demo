## About
This demo shows how automated testing and feedback has been implemented for formative exercises in an introductory programming module in the Interactive Media BSc at the University of York. The goal of this implementation is to provide students with some feedback on their work without adding constraints to the exercises that don't directly relate to the learning objectives of a specific task.
